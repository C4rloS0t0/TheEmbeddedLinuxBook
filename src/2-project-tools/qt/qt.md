# QT Tool

## What is QT?

Qt is a framework used for GUI development and we will use it for 
one of the core technologies for our software. Qt is a C++ framework 
that supports the WOCA (Write Once, Compile Anywhere) principle, which 
means Qt is a cross-platform framework. 

It’s mainly used to develop applications and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) 
that can run across different operating systems.

Qt framework provides such collaboration tools as Qt Creator, Qt Quick, 
Qt Design Studio, and others. You can quickly build future-proof projects 
using Qt with fewer feedback loops and more efficient iterations.

There’s also a specific software development language for user interface-focused 
apps offered by Qt, which is called Qt Modeling Language (QML). It can be used 
with Java, Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, and other programming languages.
