# Project Tool

This section will provide a installation guide for required tools to 
work with AGL project. 

In order to work on the AGL project we will require a set of tools to 
configure, develop and test all of our system components.

Our basic tool-set will be specific to the case of having Windows OS 
as the host system, if you have other OS like Ubuntu Linux some of the 
tools will not be required or will need to be replaced by an alternative tool.

Basic Tool-set includes:
    - WSL (Windows Subsystem Layer)
    - Putty (Serial and SSH Client)
    - QT (GUI framework)
    - Virtual Box

    You will find more information about each tool and how to setup and configure 
    for the project on the next sections.
